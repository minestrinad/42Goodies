# Git ACP Script *git-acp.sh*

This script automates the process of adding, committing, and pushing changes for one or multiple Git repositories within a specified directory. The script is designed to enhance efficiency in managing multiple repositories simultaneously.

### Usage:

1. **Requirements:**
   - Bash shell environment
   - Git installed

2. **Script Parameters:**
   - `<path_to_directory>`: The path to the directory containing Git repositories.

3. **Running the Script:**
   ```bash
   ./git-acp.sh <path_to_directory>
   ```

### Script Features:

- **Prompt for Commit Message:**
  - The script prompts the user for a commit message for each repository. If no message is provided, it defaults to a timestamped commit.

- **Direct Push from Directory:**
  - If the specified directory itself is a Git repository, the script will add, commit, and push changes directly from that directory.

- **Iterative Processing:**
  - For each subdirectory within the specified directory that contains a Git repository, the script performs the following actions:
    - Adds all changes.
    - Prompts for a commit message.
    - Commits changes with a default or user-specified message.
    - Pushes changes to the remote repository.

- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Provides colored console output for better visibility:
    - Errors are displayed in red.
    - Processing messages are displayed in green.

### Example Usage:

1. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   ./git-acp.sh ~/Desktop/path/to/repos
   ```
   Adjust the path accordingly.

2. **Follow Prompts:**
   - The script will guide you through providing commit messages for each repository or accepting timestamped default messages.

3. **Review Output:**
   - The script displays processing messages for each repository, making it easy to track the progress.

### Notes:

- Ensure the script has executable permissions: `chmod +x git-acp.sh`.
- The script uses the default branch for pushing. Modify the `git push` command if your branch differs.

**Enjoy automating your Git workflow with the Git ACP script!**

# Clean Repository Script *(clean-repo.sh)*

This Bash script is designed to provide a comprehensive cleaning solution for repositories, particularly those following the 42 norm rules. It recursively cleans all subdirectories containing a Makefile and removes executable files, object files, temporary files, and hidden files (excluding `.git`, `.`, and `..`) within the specified directory.

### Usage:

```bash
./clean-repo.sh <path_to_directory>
```

### Script Features:

- **Recursive Cleaning:**
  - The script recursively traverses all subdirectories within the specified directory, identifying those containing a Makefile. It then executes `make fclean` within each identified repository, adhering to the 42 norm rules.

- **File Cleanup:**
  - Removes the following files from the specified directory:
    - Executable files with the extension `.out`.
    - Object files with the extension `.o`.
    - Temporary files with names ending in `~`.
    - Hidden files (excluding `.git`, `.`, and `..`).

- **Caution :warning::**
  - The script uses `rm -f` to forcefully remove files. Exercise caution while using this script, and ensure you have a backup if needed.

### Notes:

- **42 Norm Rules:**
  - This script aligns with the 42 norm rules, cleaning executable and object files, temporary files, and hidden files within the specified directory.

- **Makefile Cleaning:**
  - The script prioritizes cleaning subdirectories with a Makefile, executing `make fclean` to ensure thorough repository cleanup.

### Usage Example:

```bash
./clean-repo.sh ~/Desktop/my_project
```

### Caution Alert:warning::

- **Use with Caution:warning::**
  - Be mindful when running this script, especially the `rm -f` commands, as they forcefully remove files without confirmation.

**Note:** The script follows the 42 norm rules, and while it provides a comprehensive cleaning solution, it may not suit all project structures. Adjust the script as needed for specific requirements.

**Enjoy maintaining a clean repository with the Clean Repository Script!**
